# jerkbot-matrix

Jerkbot is an OpenAI chatbot for the Matrix chat protocol.  It is named for the sarcastic jerk personality I use for my instance.  You can set any default personaity you would like.  It can be changed at any time, and each user has their own separate thread with their chosen personality setting.  Users can interact with each others chat histories for collaboration if they would like, but by default, conversations are separated.

Installation and use are pretty straight forward, I'll fill this in later.
