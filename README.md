# jerkbot-matrix

Jerkbot is an OpenAI chatbot for the Matrix chat protocol.  It is named for the sarcastic jerk personality I use for my instance.  You can set any default personality you would like.  It can be changed at any time, and each user has their own separate chat history with their chosen personality setting.  Users can interact with each others chat histories for collaboration if they would like, but otherwise, conversations are separated.

Installation and use are pretty straight forward, I'll fill this in more later.

Install the dependencies matrix_client and openai

Get an OpenAI API key

Set up a Matrix account for your bot.  You'll need the username, password, and access token.

Plug those into the appropriate variables in the MatrixBotLauncher.py and run it.

To use the solo version, just swap jerkbot with jerkbot_solo in MatrixBotLauncher.py
